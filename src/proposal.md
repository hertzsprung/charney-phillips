# A proposal for a generalised Charney--Phillips-like staggering of variables for arbitrarily-structured meshes

The Charney--Phillips vertical staggering of variables ([Charney and Phillips 1953](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(1953)010<0071:NIOTQG>2.0.CO;2)) is suitable for structured meshes with cells stacked in columns.
This staggering has been adopted by several operational models ([Davies et al. 2005](https://doi.org/10.1256/qj.04.101), [Girard et al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-13-00255.1)) because it avoids the computational mode that is associated with the Lorenz vertical staggering ([Arakawa and Konor 1996](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(1996)124<0511:VDOTPE>2.0.CO;2)).
The generalisation of the Lorenz staggering for unstructured or arbitrarily-structured meshes is straightforward ([Weller and Shahrokhi 2014](https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-14-00054.1)) but this is not true for the Charney--Phillips staggering.

On a finite volume mesh, variables are ordinarily placed at cell centres or cell faces.  In the Charney--Phillips staggering, the thermodynamic variable is placed at only those cell faces that lie on the vertical coordinate surfaces, and vertically-oriented faces have no thermodynamic information.

## who uses unusual meshes?

* unstructured (triangular) meshes ([Smolarkiewicz and Szmelter 2011](https://doi.org/10.2478/s11600-011-0043-z))
* locally-refined block-structured meshes ([Yamazaki and Satomura 2012](https://doi.org/10.1002/asl.358), [Hubbard and Nikiforakis 2003](https://doi.org/10.1175//2568.1)?)
* other AMR: behrens1996,1998 and giraldo2000 on triangular grids, see hubbard-nikiforakis
* grid nesting?

<!---
Almost all atmospheric models treat horizontal and vertical dimensions separately, leading to separate choices of horizontal and vertical staggerings.  In the horizontal, the Arakawa C-grid is commonly used because inertio-gravity waves have accurate dispersion properties [Arakawa and Lamb 1977](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nN_4561KTIIC&lpg=PA173&ots=yKV39fe7eu&dq=Computational%20design%20of%20the%20basic%20dynamical%20processes%20of%20the%20UCLA%20general%20circulation%20model&lr&pg=PA173#v=onepage&q&f=false).
