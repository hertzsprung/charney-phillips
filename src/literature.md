## Possible discrepancies

Are these correct assertions:
* Tokioka 1978 advocate their C' staggering which Zhu and Smith 2003 seem to call an A-grid.  Zhu and Smith 2003 say that Arakawa and Moorthi 1988 show why it is bad.
* Yakimiw and Girard 1987 says that Staniforth and Daley 1977 are unstaggered but it seems that they might actually be staggered?  In any case Schneider 1987 says they avoid the Lorenz computational mode.
